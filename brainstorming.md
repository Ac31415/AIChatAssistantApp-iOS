## Favorite Existing Apps - Categorize and Evaluate
### Instagram
   - **Category:** Photo & Video / Social 
   - **Mobile:** Website is view only, uses camera, mobile first experience.
   - **Story:** Allows users to share their lives in pictures and enhance their content with filters
   - **Market:** Anyone that takes pictures could enjoy this app. Ability to follow and hashtag based on interests and categories allows users with unique interests to engage with relevant content.
   - **Habit:** Users can post throughout the day many times. Features like "Stories" encourage more candid posting as well. Users can explore endless pictures in any category imaginable whenever they want. Very habbit forming!
   - **Scope:** Instagram started out extremely narrow focused, just posting pics and viewing feeds. Has expanded to a somewhat larger scope including "Instagram Stories" (a la SnapChat) and messenger features. 
### Rover

## New App Ideas - List
1. On-Device GPT
   - Allows everyone to ask a local GPT any questions on device. So the app can also work offline.
2. Fundraiser Bike Ride App
    - Allows volunteers / host to place waypoints on various routes for the fundraising event. And also allows rider participants to follow along the registered routes with waypoints that have audible sponsors at key points.
3. VR/AR Jamming EQ App
    - A companion app that allows virtual EQ'ing while jamming virtually with the host jamming VR app.

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. On-Device GPT
   - **Description**: Allows everyone to ask a local GPT any questions on device. So the app can also work offline.
   - **Category:** Productivity.
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the privacy of the users' search query. Since the GPT model is on-device, the user can ask the GPT anywhere, even places where WiFi is inaccessible.
   - **Story:** The need for AI doesn’t always align with connectivity. Whether you’re on a plane, in a remote area, or simply want control over your data, this app empowers you with a personal assistant that works anytime, anywhere—without sending a single word to the cloud.
   - **Market:** Power users, digital nomads, students, professionals, and privacy-conscious individuals. Especially valuable in industries like legal, healthcare, or government where data confidentiality is critical. Could also appeal to enterprise users as a secure AI layer within internal apps. 
   - **Habit:** Highly habitual for knowledge work—daily usage expected for note-taking, summarization, coding help, or planning. Offline availability makes it a go-to tool in both casual and mission-critical workflows.
   - **Scope:** Medium. The MVP includes a compact LLM with local inference, system prompt customization, and a basic text UI. Advanced features could include voice integration, file summarization, plug-in support, and cross-app context awareness (e.g., assist while emailing or coding). Requires deep model optimization, hardware-specific tuning, and a thoughtful UX for AI interactions.

2. VR/AR Jamming EQ App
   - **Description**: An immersive app that lets musicians and producers jam together in virtual or augmented reality, using spatialized audio and real-time collaborative mixing tools. Users can join virtual jam sessions, tweak equalizers (EQ), reverb, and effects in 3D space, and visualize sound waveforms or levels around them.
   - **Category:**  Music / VR-AR / Social / Creative Tools
   - **Mobile:** No (Optimized for VR/AR headsets like Meta Quest, Apple Vision Pro, or AR-capable smart glasses); companion mobile app possible for session scheduling and mixing presets.
   - **Story:** Born from the challenge of remote musical collaboration, especially post-2020, this app empowers artists to break geographic barriers and recreate the energy of a shared studio in a fully virtual or augmented space. It’s for producers who want immersive control, and musicians craving live jamming even from afar.
   - **Market:** Target users include amateur and professional musicians, audio engineers, music students, and creative hobbyists. It taps into the growing demand for immersive creative tools, with potential in both B2C (individual creators) and B2B (music schools, production studios, VR platforms).
   - **Habit:** Usage could range from weekly creative sessions to daily practice, especially for those replacing in-person meetups or working on collaborative tracks. Stickiness increases with strong social features (friend invites, jam history, custom setups).
   - **Scope:** Medium-to-large. The core MVP would focus on real-time EQ and spatial audio jamming. Advanced features (3D waveform visualization, gesture-based controls, AI-assisted mixing, multiplayer latency smoothing) would follow. Requires significant investment in audio processing, VR interface design, and low-latency networking.
